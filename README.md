## Projects
**Title**: ***Drone Swarm Communication and Co-ordination Using 5G technology and RFD radio modem.***
<p align="justify">
  This project focuses on the distributed communications system amongst drone swarms for research and rescue purposes. 
  In this work, the telemetry data (e.g. text, video, etc.) is shared amongst the drone for real-time shape formation 
  and with the ground control station's mission planner for tracking. It uses an RFD900x2 long-range radio modem and 
  5G dongles to transmit and receive the data.

**Title**: ***Codebook Design and Autoencoder-based Codeword Selection for RIS-assisted Communications***

<p align="justify"> 
This project focuses on optimizing beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in indoor settings. 
The codebook comprises phase patterns at RIS elements, directing signals to desired angles, and is designed to 
maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver (RX). To reduce redundancy and enhance efficiency,
We've developed an algorithm that streamlines the codebook by eliminating repetitive codewords. Furthermore,
We employ an Autoencoder (AE) for codeword selection, minimizing the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the receiver.
Our approach demonstrates promising results in terms of BER reduction while maintaining a compact codebook 
size, surpassing existing techniques.

**Title**: ***Implementation of Smart Radio Environment***
<p align="justify"> 
This project showcases the implementation of an intelligent radio environment (SRE) communication system using
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Positioned between the transmitter and receiver, the RIS reflects 
incident waves in specific directions, enhancing signal quality.
The experimental setup comprises a channel estimator (CE), a generic RIS controller (GRC), and a RIS-specific 
controller (RSC), with USRP devices acting as the transmitter and receiver. The CE adjusts RIS settings based 
on throughput requirements, following TSDSI standards for interface and message exchange between the wireless system and RIS.
This standardized approach achieves a remarkable 20 dBm improvement in received power when deploying RIS.
Additionally, the GRC employs an algorithm to optimize beamforming angles for maximum received power.

**Title**:  ***Smart-ambulance: Services using Multiple Network Paths and Open APIs***

<p align="justify"> 
This project focuses on improving patient care by integrating smart ambulance services with healthcare systems.
We introduce a solution for streaming high-definition video using multiple network paths and interfaces. 
Our approach optimizes video distribution and reliability, reducing delay and jitter in multi-access scenarios.
Additionally, we provide standardized APIs to access live data from smart ambulances, enhancing hospital system
responsiveness during critical situations. The portfolio includes product-level implementation details and real-world results,
validating our algorithms.
